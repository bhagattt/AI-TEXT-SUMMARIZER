<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>This project uses the api of hugging face's facebook/bart-large-cnn model. This model is a variant of BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) fine-tuned for summarization tasks.</p>
<p>For a given long text it sends request via API and responds back with a summarised text.</p>
